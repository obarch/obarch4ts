# Livedoc

Livedoc allow you to write Jest test in Markdown file, to solve following problems

* You have unit test, but lack of context so that readers can not know what is actually being tested
* You have documentation, but it is frequently out of date
* Easier to visualize table driven test in rendered html files

# Quick Start

```
yarn add @obarch/livedoc --dev
